handsfreescroller
=================

Scroll pages by using hand gestures in front of a webcam. Useful for people who find fine movements painful (ie arthritis sufferers).

It's only for Mac at the moment, but should be easy to port to other platforms - only the key generation needs to be rewritten to use X11/Windows.

Written in the Qt framework.


You'll need opencv. To get it with MacPorts:

sudo port -v selfupdate
sudo port install opencv
